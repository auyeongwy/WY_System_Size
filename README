Simply prints out sizes of different C/C++ data types on the OS this is run on. I used this to confirm type sizes when I was trying to confirm type differences between Linux and Windows.

To compile, just run 'make' on Linux or 'nmake /f WinMakefile' on Windows. Similarly, 'make clean' or 'nmake /f WinMakefile' on the respective OS cleans up the generated output files.  

Simply amend the Makefile or source code to change the OS name printed.

The code is so simple there is not much else to say. It's less than 25 lines and that includes the comment lines and spacing.
